# Overview

Open Source web3 client that consumes the content of a headless CMS and displays information based on the tokens you have or your activity in blockchain. This functionality enables the gamification of communities and their effective use, being able to discriminate access to content based on the behavior of each user to the community, having been all recorded in the blockchain.

# Features



* Connection with Ghost to retrieve the content (pages, posts, tags, authors and navigation).
* web3 login.
* Discrimination of content by web3 based on:
    * NFTs held by the user.
    * ERC20 tokens held by the user.
* Content discrimination management administration (content relationship with NFTs, erc20, etc).

# Tech stack

* Next.js with the following packages:
    * XXX
* Ghost CMS (headless).
